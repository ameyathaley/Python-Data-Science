## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

We started the analysis by creating a data dictionary to understand the structure of the dataset and what each feature represents. Post that, we handled the missing values in some of the columns by either dropping the rows or imputing them with the mode values, depending on the percentage of nulls in each feature. We transformed and some of the columns like Installs, Size and Price to numeric type for ease of analysis.
After establishing a good sense of each feature, we proceeded with some basic EDA.
